<p>Hello, welcome to my page! I have much to share with you! I'm hoping you'll learn a lot.</p>


  
  <p> I'm Alana and I enjoy hiking with friends and my dogs! I also enjoy cooking and traveling. </p>
  <p> I dislike Avid homework and mean cats. Also, I dislike opera music. </p>
  
  <h2> Fun facts:</h2>
    <p> I want to be super tall (like WNBA tall). </p>
    <p> My two loves are my doggos, Lily (Lilian) and Dewey. Lily is a sweet black lab and pit mix. Dewey is a fiesty white chihuahua. </p>
