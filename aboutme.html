<h1>Alana's Portfolio</h1>
<p>Hello, welcome to my page! I have much to share with you! I'm hoping you'll learn a lot.</p>
  <p> I'm Alana and I enjoy hiking with friends and my dogs! I also enjoy cooking and traveling. </p>
  <p> I dislike Avid homework and mean cats. Also, I dislike opera music. </p>
  <p> Fun facts: I want to be super tall (like WNBA tall). </p>
